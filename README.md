# Wheels On Motion (Android APK) üì±ü¶Ω

**Wheels On Motion ‚Äì Android Edition** is the data-capturing companion app for the artistic sound project [Wheels On Motion (Windows)](https://github.com/zeligmax/Wheels_On_Motion_Windows).

This Android app collects real-time motion data from wheelchair movement using your device‚Äôs built-in sensors. The data is saved in a readable `.txt` file, which can then be imported into the desktop sound application to generate immersive audio landscapes.

## üì≤ What It Does

The app continuously records the following:

- üåç **Latitude**
- üåê **Longitude**
- üèî **Altitude**
- üéõ **Gyroscope X, Y, Z**

It saves this information at a consistent sampling rate into a `.txt` file, creating a digital trace of a path, vibration, slope, and movement irregularities.

> This data becomes the raw material for a sonic exploration of mobility through [this companion desktop app](https://github.com/zeligmax/Wheels_On_Motion_Windows/tree/main).

## üîä Companion App for Sound Generation

To transform your recorded wheelchair movement into sound, download and use the [Windows Desktop Application](https://github.com/zeligmax/Wheels_On_Motion_Windows/tree/main).

That app interprets this motion data as pitch, rhythm, texture, and spatial sound.

## üé® Artistic Intent

> _Mobility becomes audible._

This project exposes the often-invisible challenges of navigating public and private spaces in a wheelchair.  
Through sound, it offers a new way to perceive effort, vibration, and spatial complexity ‚Äî turning invisible architecture into audible expression.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Permissions

The app may require the following Android permissions:

- Access Fine Location (GPS)
- Access to storage (for saving/exporting files)
- Sensor data access (gyroscope)
